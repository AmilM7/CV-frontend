To install Angular on local system, following requirements are needed:
Node.js - since Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js.
Download and install NodeJS from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
npm package manager - Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm packages for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, npm package manager is required. In order to install Angular CLI, run the following command: npm install -g @angular/cli
Navigate into that repository: cd (path)
Run the command: npm install or npm i, that will install all dependencies.
